**Understanding the Problem:**

The task is to split a 3D model represented in an OBJ file format into four equal parts using C#. This requires understanding the OBJ file format and the principles of 3D model manipulation.

**Proposed Approach:**

1. **Load the OBJ File:**
   - Use a library like AssimpNet or OpenTK to load the OBJ file and parse its data into a suitable data structure (e.g., a list of vertices and faces).

2. **Analyze the Model:**
   - Calculate the bounding box of the model to determine its dimensions.
   - Identify the center point of the bounding box.

3. **Split the Model:**
   - Divide the bounding box into four equal quadrants.
   - For each vertex in the model:
     - Determine which quadrant it belongs to based on its coordinates relative to the center point.
     - Create four separate lists of vertices, one for each quadrant.
     - Create four separate lists of faces, associating each face with the vertices in its corresponding quadrant.

4. **Create the Output OBJ Files:**
   - For each of the four lists of vertices and faces:
     - Write a new OBJ file, including the vertex data and face indices from the corresponding lists.

**Code Implementation (using OpenTK):**

```csharp
using System.IO;
using OpenTK.Graphics.OpenGL4;
using OpenTK.Mathematics;

// ... (other necessary imports)

public class ModelSplitter
{
    public static void SplitModel(string inputFilePath, string outputPrefix)
    {
        // Load the OBJ file
        var model = new Model(inputFilePath);

        // Get the bounding box and center point
        var boundingBox = model.GetBoundingBox();
        var center = (boundingBox.Max + boundingBox.Min) / 2;

        // Create four lists to store vertices and faces for each quadrant
        var quadrants = new List<List<Vector3>>() { new(), new(), new(), new() };
        var faces = new List<List<int>>() { new(), new(), new(), new() };

        // Assign vertices and faces to quadrants
        foreach (var vertex in model.Vertices)
        {
            var quadrantIndex = GetQuadrantIndex(vertex, center);
            quadrants[quadrantIndex].Add(vertex);
        }

        foreach (var face in model.Faces)
        {
            var quadrantIndices = face.Vertices.Select(v => GetQuadrantIndex(model.Vertices[v], center)).ToList();
            if (quadrantIndices.Distinct().Count() == 1)
            {
                faces[quadrantIndices[0]].Add(face.Index);
            }
            else
            {
                // Handle faces that cross quadrant boundaries (e.g., by splitting them)
            }
        }

        // Write the output OBJ files
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
        {
            var outputFilePath = $"{outputPrefix}{i + 1}.obj";
            WriteObjFile(outputFilePath, quadrants[i], faces[i]);
        }
    }

    private static int GetQuadrantIndex(Vector3 vertex, Vector3 center)
    {
        if (vertex.X >= center.X && vertex.Y >= center.Y) return 0; // Top-right
        if (vertex.X < center.X && vertex.Y >= center.Y) return 1; // Top-left
        if (vertex.X < center.X && vertex.Y < center.Y) return 2; // Bottom-left
        return 3; // Bottom-right
    }

    private static void WriteObjFile(string filePath, List<Vector3> vertices, List<int> faces)
    {
        // ... (implementation for writing OBJ file)
    }
}
```

**Key Considerations:**

- **OBJ File Format:** Ensure correct handling of vertex normals and texture coordinates if present in the input file.
- **Quadrant Assignment:** Consider edge cases where vertices lie on quadrant boundaries.
- **Face Splitting:** For faces that cross quadrant boundaries, splitting them into multiple faces may be necessary.
- **Library Choice:** The choice of library (AssimpNet, OpenTK, or others) will affect the specific implementation details.
- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for file loading, parsing, and writing.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Model Complexity:** For more complex models, you might need to consider more sophisticated splitting algorithms or techniques like mesh decomposition.
- **Accuracy:** Ensure that the splitting process preserves the original model's shape and topology as much as possible.

By following these steps and addressing the key considerations, you can effectively split your 3D model into four equal parts using C#.
